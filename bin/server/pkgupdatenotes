crontab entry
customize the config file

need a non-pkg sendmail in /etc/mailer.conf, or use custom mail feature

features:
	bulk-build of a specific set of packages, in a chroot (so it doesn't uninstall existing packages)
	fairly simple to configure
	build scripts won't rebuild anything that's already built
		...unless it depends on something that was rebuilt :)
	installer script tries to be super-safe, but it's possible to get in trouble
	if one package is broken, you find out before you try it in production
	single package list (in /etc)
	can hand-build packages, like usual

remember util.sh
